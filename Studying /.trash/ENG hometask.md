1. Some bacteria can survive in extreme environments like deep-sea hydrothermal vents or Antarctic ice by entering inactive state for thousands of years.  
2. The human gut contains roughly 38 trillion bacterial cells and they play crucial role in immunity, digestion, and even mood regulation.  
3. Certain bacteria, like *Deinococcus radiodurans*, can withstand radiation doses 5,000 times higher than what would kill a human. They survive by rapidly repairing shattered DNA.
