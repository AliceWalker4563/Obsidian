> The science of enzymes is **enzymology** [ɛnˌzaɪˈmɒlədʒi]. The term **enzyme** [ˈɛnzaɪm] was introduced by J. Berzelius: “catalysts supplied by living cells.”

### Characteristics of Enzymes:

- **Similarities with all catalysts:**
	- Not consumed in the reaction,
	- Accelerate only those reactions that are thermodynamically feasible without them,
	- Do not shift the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction; they only speed up its attainment.

- **Features unique to enzymes:**
	- By nature, **exclusively proteins** (ribozymes [ˈraɪboʊzaɪmz] are not classified as enzymes),
	- Nearly 100% yield of the desired product (the enzyme accelerates only one specific reaction pathway, yielding exclusively that product),
	- Exceptionally high catalytic efficiency under mild conditions—no need for high temperature or pressure (e.g., at 25 °C, urea decomposition to ammonia is accelerated by **10¹³-fold** in the presence of the enzyme),
	- **Specificity** [spəˌsɪfɪˈsɪti] of action (selectivity—recognizes specific functional groups or structural motifs in the substrate),
	- **Regulatability** [ˌrɛɡjʊleɪtəˈbɪləti] (e.g., via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, calmodulin [ˌkælˈmɒdʒʊlɪn]-dependent kinases, allosteric [ˌæləˈstɛrɪk] enzymes).

### Specificity

**Absolute specificity**: the enzyme catalyzes the transformation of only one specific molecule.
**Relative (group) specificity**: the enzyme acts on a group of structurally related substrates.  
	  *Examples*:  
- **Pepsin** [ˈpɛpsɪn] cleaves peptide bonds **before** aromatic amino acids,  
- **Trypsin** [ˈtrɪpsɪn] cleaves **after** lysine and arginine,  
- **Chymotrypsin** [ˌkaɪmoʊˈtrɪpsɪn] cleaves **after** aromatic amino acids,  
- **Carboxypeptidase A** [ˌkɑːrˌbɒksiˈpɛptɪˌdeɪs eɪ] removes amino acids one by one from the C-terminus; its rate depends on the amino acid type—it does **not** cleave proline or arginine.

Specificity is determined by the amino acid composition of the **active site** [ˈæktɪv saɪt].  
For instance:  
- In **trypsin**, the active site contains **aspartate** (negatively charged), which attracts positively charged side chains (Lys, Arg).  
- In **chymotrypsin**, the active site is large and lined with hydrophobic and uncharged polar amino acids to accommodate aromatic residues.

### Regulatability

Examples include:
- **Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation**: Glycogen phosphorylase [ˈɡlaɪkədʒən fɒsˈfɒrɪleɪs] (converts glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate) is active **only** in its phosphorylated form. A kinase phosphorylates it; a phosphatase dephosphorylates it.
- **Calmodulin-dependent kinases**: Calmodulin changes conformation upon binding Ca²⁺ ions, thereby activating the kinase.
- **Allosteric enzymes**: Possess, in addition to the active site, an **allosteric regulatory site** where an effector binds non-covalently, inducing a conformational change that modulates enzyme activity.

### Active Site

The active site is typically located in a **structural cleft**—a depression in the protein globule. This cleft allows the substrate to be surrounded by numerous amino acid residues from all sides.

The location of the active site correlates with function:  
- In **endoglucanase** [ˌɛndoʊˈɡluːkəˌneɪs] (cleaves internal glycosidic bonds in cellulose), the active site is **exposed** on the surface.  
- In **exoglucanase** [ˌɛksoʊˈɡluːkəˌneɪs] (processively cleaves from chain ends), the active site lies within a **tunnel-like loop** through which the substrate chain threads.

The active site **does not exist** in the primary structure of the protein. It forms only during **folding**. Amino acid residues that constitute the active site may be distant in the linear sequence but become spatially adjacent after proper folding.

### Cofactors

- **Inorganic**:
  - Metal ions (e.g., Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺),
  - Iron–sulfur clusters (e.g., [2Fe–2S], [4Fe–4S]).
- **Organic**:
  - Nucleotide-derived (e.g., AMP, FAD, NAD⁺),
  - Vitamin derivatives (e.g., ascorbic acid [vitamin C], nicotinamide [from vitamin B₃]),
  - Aliphatic compounds (e.g., glutathione [ˈɡluːtəθaɪˌoʊn]).

**Metal-activated enzymes** can function (albeit poorly) without their metal ion, whereas **metalloenzymes** are absolutely dependent on metals (e.g., nitrogenase [ˈnaɪtrədʒəˌneɪs] requires Mo and Fe; peroxidase [pəˈrɒksɪˌdeɪs] requires heme-Fe; α-amylase [ˈælfaɪ ˈæmɪˌleɪs] requires Ca²⁺).

Nicotinamide-containing coenzymes consist of a nitrogenous base (nicotinamide), ribose, and phosphate groups.  
- **NAD⁺** (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide): oxidized form  
- **NADH**: reduced form  

Dehydrogenases using NAD⁺ are called **nicotinamide-dependent**, while those using FAD are **flavoproteins**.  
- **FAD** (flavin adenine dinucleotide) [flævɪn ˈædəˌniːn daɪˈnjuːkliəˌtaɪd]: oxidized form  
- **FADH₂**: reduced form  

Cofactors are classified as:
- **Coenzymes** [ˈkoʊˌɛnzaɪmz]: loosely bound (e.g., NAD⁺),
- **Prosthetic groups** [ˈprɒsθɛtɪk ɡruːps]: tightly/covalently bound (e.g., FAD in succinate dehydrogenase).

Glutathione is a tripeptide (Glu–Cys–Gly), but it is **non-ribosomal**: the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate forms a peptide bond—this cannot be synthesized on ribosomes.

**Apoenzyme** [ˌæpoʊˈɛnzaɪm] + **cofactor** = **holoenzyme** [ˌhoʊloʊˈɛnzaɪm]

#### Functions of the two-component enzyme:
- **Apoenzyme**:
  - Determines substrate specificity,
  - Enhances the catalytic efficiency of the cofactor.
- **Cofactor**:
  - Directly participates in catalysis,
  - Mediates interaction between apoenzyme and substrate,
  - Stabilizes the apoenzyme structure,
  - In some enzymes, cofactors serve as **photosensors**—switching the enzyme to its active state upon light absorption.

### Enzyme Classification

#### By reaction type (established in 1961 by the Enzyme Commission):
1. **Oxidoreductases** [ˌɒksɪdoʊrɪˈdʌktɪsiz] (electron transfer),
2. **Transferases** [ˈtrænsfəreɪsiz] (transfer of functional groups),
3. **Hydrolases** [ˈhaɪdrəˌleɪsiz] (hydrolysis reactions),
4. **Lyases** [ˈlaɪeɪsiz] / **synthases** (cleavage or formation of C=C, C=O, etc., without ATP),
5. **Isomerases** [aɪˈsɒməreɪsiz] (intramolecular rearrangements),
6. **Ligases** [ˈlaɪɡeɪsiz] / **synthetases** (bond formation—C–C, C–S, C–O, C–N—with ATP hydrolysis),
7. **Translocases** [trænsˈloʊkeɪsiz] (transport of ions/molecules across membranes).

Each enzyme has a unique **EC number** (Enzyme Commission number) with four digits:  
**EC a.b.c.d**  
- *a* = class,  
- *b* = subclass,  
- *c* = sub-subclass,  
- *d* = serial number.

**Examples**:  
- **EC 1.18.6.1**: nitrogenase (reduces N₂ to NH₃),  
- **EC 2.1.3.3**: ornithine carbamoyltransferase (forms citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine),  
- **EC 3.5.3.1**: arginase (hydrolyzes arginine → urea + ornithine),  
- **EC 4.3.2.1**: argininosuccinate lyase (cleaves argininosuccinate → arginine + fumarate),  
- **EC 5.4.2.2**: phosphoglucomutase (converts glucose-6-phosphate ↔ glucose-1-phosphate),  
- **EC 6.3.4.5**: argininosuccinate synthetase (joins aspartate to citrulline),  
- **EC 7.1.2.2**: ATP synthase (synthesizes ATP from ADP + Pᵢ).

### Isoenzymes (Multiple Molecular Forms of Enzymes – MMFE)

**Multiple molecular forms of enzymes (MMFE)** are a group of enzymes that catalyze the **same reaction** in a single biological species but differ in structure and physicochemical properties: activity, substrate affinity, response to regulators, electrophoretic mobility. **Over half** of all enzymes exist as MMFE.

*Example*: **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** [ˈlækteɪt ˌdiːhaɪˈdrɒdʒɪneɪs], EC 1.1.1.27, converts pyruvate ↔ lactate.  
It is a **tetramer** composed of two subunit types:  
- **M** (muscle-type),  
- **H** (heart-type).  

Possible combinations: M₄, H₄, M₃H, M₂H₂, MH₃, etc.  
- **H-rich isoforms**: predominant in heart, high affinity for lactate, inhibited by high pyruvate.  
- **M-rich isoforms**: predominant in skeletal muscle, optimized for rapid pyruvate → lactate conversion during anaerobic glycolysis.  
These isoforms are separable by **electrophoresis**.

#### Classification of MMFE:
- **Isoenzymes** (genetically distinct forms):
  - **Genetically independent proteins**: encoded by different genes,
  - **Allozymes** [ˈæləʊzaɪmz] (products of different alleles in heterozygotes),
  - **Heteropolymers**: oligomers formed from subunits encoded by different genes (e.g., LDH).
- **Post-translational variants** (from a single gene):
  - **Metazymes** [ˈmɛtəzaɪmz] (covalently modified forms (e.g., phosphorylated, AMPylated, glycosylated)),
  - **Homopolymers**: oligomers of identical subunits; activity may vary with oligomer size (dimer vs. tetramer),
  - **Conformers** [kənˈfɔːrmərz] (same sequence but different 3D conformations (includes all allosterically regulated enzymes)).
