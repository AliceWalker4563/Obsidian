The body temperature of amphibians depends on the environment temperature and humidity. 
They differ in limited ability for distribution, moving and orientation on land. 
Primitiviness of amphibians as a terrestrial animals is evident??? in the fact that their eggs don't have layers that protect them from drying, and they can't develop outside of water. 
Because of this, amphibians have an aquatic larva. 
Development involves metamorphosis, as a result of which an aquatic larva transforms into terrestrial animal. 
Amphibians is the smallest class of vertebrates, that includes only 2100 modern species, represented by 3 orders: Caudata, Apoda and Anura.
