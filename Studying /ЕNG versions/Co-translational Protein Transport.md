##### Signal Sequence and SRP [ˈsɪɡnəl ˈsiːkwəns ænd]  

Proteins destined for a specific organelle [ˌɔrɡəˈnɛl] and intended to function there contain a signal sequence within their primary structure. This signal sequence is recognized by a specialized targeting mechanism on the target organelle. Proteins lacking a signal sequence remain in the cytosol [ˈsaɪtoʊsɑl].

Co-translational translocation [ˌkoʊ-trænsˈleɪʃən] occurs during protein synthesis on ribosomes [ˈraɪbəˌsoʊmz] bound to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The signal sequence is recognized in the cytosol by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). SRP binds to the signal sequence, temporarily halts translation, and directs the nascent [ˈneɪsənt] protein together with its ribosome to the RER by binding to the SRP receptor located on the RER membrane.

##### Translocon [trænsˈloʊkɑn]  

Translocation across the RER membrane occurs through a channel called the translocon. Its gating mechanism opens only during the transfer of the nascent (growing) polypeptide [ˌpɑliˈpɛptaɪd] chain, responding to binding by the signal sequence. This gating also prevents other molecules from entering the RER lumen [ˈluːmən], thereby maintaining the RER as a distinct compartment. Ion passage is possible only briefly - during the short interval between the polypeptide passing through the channel and ribosome detachment.

**Sequence of Translocation Events:**  

1. Protein synthesis begins on a ribosome; the signal sequence emerges.  
2. The SRP receptor, located near the translocon, recognizes the signal sequence, temporarily pauses translation, and guides the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the translocon.  
3. Initially, the ribosome interacts weakly with the translocon, and the polypeptide enters the channel.  
4. The translocon recognizes the signal sequence, stabilizing the ribosome and triggering channel opening.  
5. Translation resumes, and the polypeptide is threaded through the channel into the lumen, undergoing modifications during transit.  
6. Upon completion of translation, the ribosome dissociates [daɪˈsoʊʃieɪts].

*Note:* If a large portion of the protein has already been synthesized and released from the ribosome before engagement with the translocon, translocation becomes impossible—which is why SRP temporarily halts translation upon binding the signal sequence and ribosome.

##### **Fate of Transmembrane Proteins**  

If the protein is destined to become a transmembrane [ˌtrænsˈmɛmˌbreɪn] protein, this is determined by the translocon itself upon encountering a hydrophobic [ˌhaɪdroʊˈfɑbɪk] segment that will serve as a membrane anchor. When the translocon recognizes such a hydrophobic region, it laterally releases that segment into the lipid bilayer [ˈlɪpɪd ˈbaɪˌleɪər]. This process may occur multiple times for a single protein, depending on the number of hydrophobic segments it contains.

##### **Subsequent Events**  

During or shortly after translocation, most signal sequences are cleaved off by signal peptidase [ˈsɪɡnəl ˈpɛptɪˌdeɪs]. Additional modifications may also occur, including the addition of lipid or carbohydrate [ˌkɑrboʊˈhaɪdreɪt] moieties [ˈmoʊətiz].

After translocation, proteins fold into their native conformation. This process is assisted by chaperones [ˈʃæpəˌrɑnz] (heat shock proteins) present inside the RER lumen. These chaperones also prevent misfolding and aggregation. Protein disulfide isomerase [daɪˈsʌlfaɪd aɪˈsɑməˌreɪs] catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine [ˈsɪstiˌin] residues, contributing to the tertiary structure of proteins.

Moreover, a quality control system can retrotranslocate [ˌrɛtroʊtrænsˈloʊkeɪt] misfolded proteins back into the cytosol for degradation. In the cytosol, ubiquitin [juːˈbɪkwɪtɪn] molecules are attached to the defective protein, which is then degraded by the proteasome [ˈproʊtiəˌsoʊm].
